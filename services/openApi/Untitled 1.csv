"Along with the few items I bought I had a sodastream gas canister to exchange for a full one. I handed over my canister and I was given a new one. When I got home I realised after opening it to put it in the machine it was the wrong one and didn‚Äôt fit. My husband called and spoke to a person at checkout who promptly told us that we couldn‚Äôt have our old one back as we had opened the new one. Pretty much rendering our machine useless. It took two phone calls and asking to speak to a manager to get it sorted. Why does it need to be that hard"

"I have always had very satisfactory experience at New World. This is the first time that made me somewhat dissatisfied.    A male staff at the deli section was unfriendly and unprofessional at serving ready to eat food. When I asked him why he wasn't wearing his mask to cover his mouth and nose while preparing my food, I was ignored. Plus there were parts of salad sticking outside of the container which I did inform him about it, and still doing the same action second time. From what I've observed later on, he was ignoring the other customer while that person waved at him for assistance. I did ask another female staff who served me at the same station about whether that male allowed to serve food without wearing a mask properly, she relied she doesn't know."
