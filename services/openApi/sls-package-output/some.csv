"EVERYTHING...!!!! 
The food is not fresh... meat is brown (I have many photos to prove) itﾒs very unhygienic. I have also brought food which was past the used by date many times.....  promotions ???? When buying an item that is on special, go to pay for it at the checkout and I'm paying full price... I have done this a lot, not realising I have payed full price for a lot of items until I check the receipt at home, as a local and so many other locals can vouch we only shop there because itﾒs the only shopping centre in wairoa. Many people would rather shop out of town, or at the dairy. 
Please can you do something about the new world in wairoa. 
Thank you."

"In general, I was very satisfied, as I have been with all of my online shops. However, I have been finding that the person (or one of the people) picking the vegetables at NW Warkworth does not seem to know how to pick the better ones. I have twice had broccoli that was so old that it literally was saggy, unable to stand up under it's own weight. Plus have had carrots that were in very sad condition, amongst other things. I would hope that this was just non-training in how to pick the best, as the customer themselves would do. I hope it is not taking advantage of the customer not being able to choose themselves, and ridding the store of old produce that may not sell otherwise. Also, the online product listing for the Venus extra smooth two pack of razors is deceptive, it says two razors plus two cartridges, which is not the case, it is two razors and nothing extra."

Broccoli, stands out in my memory as being ﾑoldﾒ. I passed it by.

Once I had finished packing my bags She came back from asking another staff member about her break and she stood and moaned about how she only got a 15minutes break

She also asked me to wait while fluffing on the til and also has asked to wait while she opens the floor to the cleaners. Im waiting for considerable time as she appears busy even though other staff are available. I hadnﾒt realised opening a door requires sone sort of specific skill? Must if waited over 39 mins when others could do something. This isnﾒt efficient and is wasting my time. Other stores dont do this.

"buying an item that was not available at my usual new world"
"Iﾒd bought a bottle of shampoo. The top wasnﾒt secure and it leaked over other items in my bag. Things happen.  When I returned (Iﾒd only gotten as far as the car park) Karen the duty manager and the young lad who packed were so caring and helpful replacing the spoiled product. They made me feel very valued. It was really appreciated.
EVERY staff member at Orewa New World are friendly and professional, some remember my name and are interested in how I am. For this reason its why I only shop at New World and disregard other supermarket enticing specials. 
I love Orewa NW. Thankyou.
Bev Roberts"

The NW we shopped at in Palmerston North until our move to Waiuku a year ago had a much better organic range, including the superb Bostock chicken - here, just the pseudo 'Bird and Barrow'.

I was in a bit of a hurry and I didnﾒt even wanna  give my phone number  for a member look up, this operator was very kind enough to scan a store card to give me discount for my shop.
A little goes far away and she truly has proven that..Even though I didnﾒt get any discount because I bought things with store special ,I Admired her kindness and dedication towards her customer service.
Well done Penina , I will defiantly  return back to shop as usual at roskill and will always look forward to seeing and being served by this operator.
Merry Christmas and happy New year to Mt Roskill team, well done for the awesome job you provide to your local customerﾒs.

Thanks heaps

And I was one of a number of people with trolleys that had only a small number of items to be checked out. I was stuck in a queue for a lot longer than was warranted for the number of items I had, and I was unable to transfer those items to a basket? When I asked the shop assistant for the empty basket she was holding I was told that if I had a trolley I had to go through the checkout. Not only quite annoying, but quite inefficient."

"Satisfied because the store is always clean, staff are always amazing and produce etc always good. However, I am starting to avoid going to New World because you don't stock Meadowfresh milk. I am really unsatisfied with the Anchor brand for moral reasons over their marketing and business practices, and other brands don't taste as good. Unfortunately this means my main shop (which includes several bottles of milk) is done at Countdown as milk is one of our main items in the family."

I spoke to a man & after finding out what I liked about hams he went to try & find the brand he was recommending. There was none on the shelf so he went out the back to track one down. I bought it on his recommendation & have to say itﾒs very tasty, not too sweet. Very pleased, as it was a lot more money than I would normally have spent, but worth it."

"Customer friendly"
"I find the teenagers who work in the evening are less interested in providing customer service than the staff during the day, if you are unable to find something or have a general question they are reluctant to provide anything more than a quick answer after theyﾒve had a pre-cursory glance, you almost always have to ask them to check with a supervisor without them offering to do that themselves, usually after checking with the supervisor there is a completely different answer and you know whether the item is in stock, out the back or still coming. They also stand around in a largish group chatting about their personal lives at the checkout when the store is about to close, if youﾒve rushed into the supermarket to pick up a couple of items for the next day on your way home from work and itﾒs just before closing time itﾒs uncomfortable as they stop talking or talk quietly and continue their personal conversations and will stand there watching you as a group as you quickly put your items through the self-checkout or checkout in an uncomfortable silence, once you leave they start talking again. I often also hear them talking aloud with each other about other staff members."
"The friendly  staff!"
