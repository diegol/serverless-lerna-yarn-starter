"Know this store backwards."
"I find shopping in our local turangi new world so great friendly staff always specials that we need for our everyday shop .everything is pretty easy to find as well"
"Very friendly staff"
"The staff there are always smiling and happy to help."
"Friendly staff"
"We shop in Dannevirke where there is only NW and Four Square. To take advantage of Countdown or PaknSave specials we would need to go 50 Kms to PN or Waipukurau. Not 100% happy with NW, staple foods should be cheaper, without being rubbish"
"Always good to shop at NW"
"Lots of product, clean store"
"Its a nice store, parking is easy, staff are nice"
"Wait was short Products available Pleasant staff"
"Friendly helpful staff who go the extra mile to help if needed. Patient staff at Whanganui branch. Good specials offered by New World where the items can be cheaper than any other supermarket at that time."
"Great products and helpful staff. A pleasant experience"
"I was satisfied with my shop but there could be improvements. The checkout people should be more diligent. For example, one self checkout was free for ages but the attendant didn't tell anyone so we were waiting in line for a while and it wasn't as efficient as it could be. Also, I notice at the non-self service checkouts, a lot of attendants tend to put items firstly into plastic bags without asking if you even need one. The default should be to ask do you have a bag or do you need a bag? This will drive better behaviors with shoppers and prompt them to rely less in plastic bags"
"service , good always have what i am looking for , always have new items , good lighting, friendly staff, helpful staff."
"I hate that they never seem to have enough staff on to have a packer on each till. This means that you spend longer in the queue as you have to have the scanner stop and pack items. It just feels very slow and inefficient so we wouldn't ever do our full shop there as it takes too long!"
"I was very satisfied with my shopping experience. There are so many products that the supermarket has everything I need."
"I am satisfied with the customer service. The staff there is always really nice. I am dissatisfied at the lack of wholemeal bread options (like bread rolls) that are available."
"Found what I wanted quite easily."
"Its a clean and bright store, not too crowded. Fresh produce always looks really nice."
"Great selection of unusual ingredients. Will be returning to buy a duck. However, the chicken leaked on my tomatoes because the packaging wasn't secured correctly."
"I'm very satisfied shopping at New World as they provide good service and the range of vegetable and fruits are top quality. Love their freshly bake breads too."
"Very happy staff great team love going. Their"
"Products are usually always in stock , very helpful friendly staff, great specials always available parking"
"Friendly helpful staff; excellent quality fruit and veg; shelves well stocked with high quality grocery items,;store is clean and well organised; excellent butchery."
"Lots of help"
"was overcharged"
"My son was getting unsettled and everyone we passed in the store chatted to him and at the checkout the lady played with him while we were paying keeping him happy. What would have been so stressful was a pleasure!"
"Very nice central location. It's very convenient, however prices can be a bit steep sometimes."
"A beautiful new store with lots of parking and room inside to easily move my trolley around."
"good service"
"We have regularly shopped at this store for many years & although we no longer reside in Devonport we come back quite often to do a main shop as the store is so good."
"Great selection with affordable prices!"
"It has a better quality of fruit and vege than other supermarkets, handy location on the way home."
"Everyone is very helpful and the customer service is amazing"
"Good customer service and variety"
"Friendly and efficient staff, short queues at checkouts, clean and well lit store, good bakery Negatives: fruit and veg not very fresh and expensive, many products no longer stocked now, so that I have to go to Countdown more often to get those items"
"The staff are always very friendly and helpful. Even when they are really busy they offer to help. A clear example that always stands out to me was nearly 4 years ago in the xmas rush I was 9 months pregnant and it was two days before xmas the staff offered to help me with my shopping bags and putting them in my car for me. The store is well layed out and i appreciate how clean it is. I also love the range and quality of the products they have in the deli and bakeries. Things like the rolled chickens really help with trying new flavours and are affordable. The birthday cakes are also amazing and my kids love them."
"things are slightly more expensive than i would like but the staff are really great."
"Good range which is developing more, everything was easy to find and store was easy to navigate around"
"Disatisfied with prices"
"Tidy store with good selection"
"Need better prices and promotions. Need to collect too many stamps for pods"
"It is a clean,happy staffed, friendly shop.Great layout, fresh food.No stress, really enjoyable supermarket shopping experience! !!😊"
"More varieties would be great"
"The drinks fridge by checkouts. I love trying new products and the fridge is always stocked with new drinks to try!"
"Always clean and can find thing"
"Very good service"
"Easy parking, easy access to store, excellent range of products, fast checkout process."
"Veges, fruit and meat are great. Staff are very friendly and helpful."
"I am satisfied with shopping at Kawerau New World as staff there are always pleasant and make grocery shopping enjoyable :)."
"Pretty happy but did wonder if I was overcharged on one item but it was only a small amount if in fact I was!"
"I emailed in grocery list and Jeff was able to get it done in time for Country Couriers to pick up, very good service as needed groceries for docking"
"Thorndon NW has been our main shopping store for years, so we know just how it works. It is set out well, but above all the staff are so good in every way. We are happy with the whole experience."
"The staff are polite and extremely helpful"
"I liked that it was a big store with free parking and a lot of selection. I liked that at the check out there was someone helping put the groceries away since we now have to use re-usable bags so this was very nice."
"The items are easy to find and the staff at checkout are always friendly and helpful"
"I love shopping at new world, I especially love their eco friendly items such as the bamboo toothbrushes I bought that I can't find at other supermarkets"
"Called in on the way to work - picked up a Scroll from the Bakery for breakfast and items for lunch. On the way in I ordered a coffee at the kiosk and it was ready to collect on my way back out. Great coffee - lovely fresh scroll. Quick and efficient - couldn't ask for more...unless you can relocate the bakery to the front of the shop ?? All good"
"Friendly polite staff, local, convenient supermarket"
"Staff friendly and easy to find items I require"
"I like when I go shopping to find what I want in stock. An hour ago at Newlands I wanted to buy some limes. There were ONLY two in the store."
"Good selection of products, lovely staff."
"Staff are always fast and friendly when at check out. They stock a wide range of items - would like to see more international stock especially British treats. Tons of parking so easy access to the shop"
"couldn't find breakfast sausages and the brand of jam I usually get but it's fine, can't carry everything"
"Regular things I buy have reasonable prices or are on a special which is handy"
"Staff are friendly and shop has a great atmosphere"
"I find that shopping at New World is a good experience as products are easy to find. Although at the moment the store is having a revamp but soon find where products are in temporary place. I find that there is a good variety of fruit and vegetables and stock organic products too. I find the staff are very friendly at the check-out specially the young women that served me today.Very pleased with the spaciousness since the Supermarket has been renovated."
"Everything I need is in stock, store is faced and look full."
"Plenty of checkout operators."
"Most of the time I'm satisfied because of the wide range of products. But there is often not enough checkouts open for the number of people there."
"Small easy to locate goods"
"As I said in the previous comments we love the meat and grocery range, but do find some of the staff especially at the check out can be distracted and not welcoming, and the self check out helpers can be almost abrupt and a bit rude to deal with."
"Co-operative staff and store layout is amazing."
"I'm a regular customer at this new world, I always find the customer service very satisfying and the range of products is great."
"Staff at checkouts: Some staff members will say Good morning, good afternoon or ask how you are but some staff members don't say anything. The whole store is pretty tidy and easy to find what you would like to buy. There's always plenty of trolleys except at their Christmas shopping day."
"I am satisfied by the clearly labelled aisles and the organisation of the items on shelves. I thought that the self check-out aisles, however, could have been better managed, as oftentimes people are distracted and therefore holding up the lines. The self check-out areas could also be expanded, as at the moment the area is a bit congested."
"satisfied: had the items i wanted dissatisfied: some items can be pricey"
"A quick and pleasurable experience shopping there every time"
"I love NEw World so much it is the best supermarket ever and the nicests by far. I haave recomended it to friends and family already adn go there more than once a week."
"Upon entering being greeted with flowers and fruit begins the journey nice and fresh. Only issue in store would be not many people running the check outs that meant a wee cue wait whilst I was trying to be quick"
"The customer service was great"
"I like the space and layout of the fruit and vegetables section. Having kids car parks are great."
"I could not find a couple of items on the shelves, and when I got to the checkouts I mentioned that to the young ladies at the till. I have arthritis and struggle to walk far, and have a car disability card, for easier access to the door. The young lady was helpful and pleasant, and in detail explained 'where' I could locate the missing items and in which isle. So I had to go and walk there to get them! As there was also 'a packing assistant' helping her, I thought it would've been most helpful and totally more appreciated, had she gone to collect for me instead?"
"Friendly and helpful checkout operators. Frustrating to find after taking dog for walk to supermarket and not having any bags (and purchasing some heavy things like washing powder) to be reminded I would need to purchase a bag which I hadn't brought enough money for."
"Great customer service"
"Good specials on fruit and vegetables. The carpark is always filthy with rubbish everywhere with food and drink spillage. Shopping baskets need to be cleaned regularly. There is always grime that looks like its been there a while."
"Sometimes the products that I use and always purchase at new world suddenly aren't there. I had this experience the time before last where I couldn't find an item I needed so I had to go to another large grocery shop on the other side of town, to get the item, which was the only item I purchased at the other shop. I went back to new world the next day for something else only to see that same item back on the shelf! I didn't ask an assistant at the time as it usually turns out if the item isn't on the shelf they don't have it. On the plus side I do love the shopping experience in our new world, the brightness, cleanliness, smiling and helpful staff and the wide variety of quality products"
"It's nice being so close and convenient but it's very expensive."
"Nice store. Always lovely staff. Could do with a bigger international section."
"I appreciate the good prices, good range of products and the well stocked shelves."
"Prices are always lower than pakn save, fresh meat everyday, customer service is superb, very close to my house and very clean. Most of the workers there get along very well with the community, I've always shopped there since my childhood times to now."
"The large store, cleanliness and layout are great. Unfortunately this store didn't stock Coca-Cola 100% Stevia sweetened in 1.5L or 2.25L bottles."
"Great staff. Friendly as. Always smiley."
"Local Fresh produce Small meat packs Helpful staff Lovely music Range of food stuffs"
"friendly staff"
"I have a number of breeding cats and when I go to get large bags of Whiskas meat fcat food the shelves are often empty so I go elsewhere to shop. Always empty when there is a special on. The bay only holds about 5 bags. (I usually get two -three bags) The fish food gives them digestive issues so the shelf for that is usually full. I feed out a bag a day and other wet food as well. This means I am often going to Countdown first and so often shop there instead."
"The specials on the meat are fantastic!"
"Can usually get the gluten free products I want."
"I like that the isles are in a logical order - I had something I wouldn't usually buy on my list today and found it easily."
"The shopping experience is relatively pleasant and easy to navigate through the aisles. Staff are smiling and they do their best to support and help customers. I do understand businesses need to be profitable and offer living wages to staff. However, at the scale supermarkets buy and sell, may be there is an opportunity to comparable to Countdown offers - in terms of price or experience comparator. Again, I do understand establishing these kinds of tools can be tricky and high maintenance is required including integrating relevant data points, however, we are living in a digital age where customers are expected to see these sort of things - influenced by Amazon or Pricespy experience - to determine why New World is the best super market and creates a differentiating customer experience where customer loyalty can be developed organically. It might even reduce your marketing budget once the brand loyalty is established. Thanks."
"I was doing a shop for essential home items, cleaning products etc. after moving into a new house. There were a lot of really great specials in-store, I was very happy with the savings I made by shopping here."
"I got the items required. Didn't wait long to be served at checkout."
"The staff helps me lift heavy items, like 15l water bottles into my trolley. They open a new till if the customers are in a too long waiting row. They are friendly. They pack my stores into my bags. I am rewarded for bringing my own bag. The shop has the type of food and the quality of food I like. They greet me when i enter and leave the shop. They make my shopping experience a pleasant one (i hate shopping usually)."
"I'm very satisfied with New World Rotorua Westend as I always find the staff to be very helpful and they always greet me with a smile and to see if I need help."
"Wish prices were lower."
"I like going there because they have a bigger variety of foods than other supermarkets and the meats/fish always looks fresher. The people are also very friendly even after a long day so that's important when you are tired or you've had a bad day. I also know where to find everything I want at New World because their stores are pretty much plaid out the same at all stores."
"Everything handy and Customer service so great"
"The fruit and vegetable section in this supermarket is beautifully displayed, always. Also love the variety of brands they have for each product"
"Store layout, products and service."
"I am so proud to shop at new world I think it's the best super market because the staff are so helpful especially for the elderly people that can't really do there shopping by them selves. So the staff from new world are friendly and help them. Mind you they help everyone."
"I find the Albany store is well set out and feels spacious. The displays of specialty items are very attractive A staff member took the time to help me locate a particular wine label."
"Store is a good size and easy to find items. Great having 2 people on checkouts. The checkouts are very tight and small though"
"The store always looks clean and the shelves are stocked well. Staff are willing to help. It's a pity the store is so small and going underground from street level, is a strange feeling. It seems a long way to enter the store."
"Had mostly everything I needed"
"The tills match the shoppers (more shoppers, more tills open) and the staff are friendly and helpful - pretty well what I'd expect but you don't get it at all supermarkets."
"Satisfied- it is easy to find what I am looking for and I am in and out very quickly, and the staff are always welcoming, friendly, and helpful."
"OMG. Where do I start.......Ultra clean supermarket, fresh veges, spaced out as you walk through the door, beautiful selection of meats especially in the butchers display. I was awesomely surprised at the additional delights they have now behind the glass display, yum. The deli very clean and nicely displayed, very tempting. Hard to walk past that without buying. The aisles are nice and wide which makes shopping pleasant. If there isn't a product that I like to buy, I ask for what I want and they'll get it in. Over in the frozen department, with the cold foods right opposite, is very easy to choose what I want. Very spaced out and easy to find my necessities. Then the wine department....this morning I asked Laki if he could get my wine in, and with a smile he said yes. He gave me his email so I could send him a pic of the barcode to which I've done and I look forward to being able to pick up what I need next week. (saves me going to the other supermarkets for what I need) Finally the staff.......they are everywhere, up the aisles and the checkouts, behind the counters and very friendly. I can not fault this supermarket. I am a hard person to please at the best of times and this Supermarket is a pleasurable experience."
"Friendly helpful staff. More space at checkouts."
"fast friendly service"
"Love the store. Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff, great wine selection"
"The store is a couple of minutes away from where I live, so easily accessible. It's a big clean store .I like the deli and Bakery and shop from that dept. a lot. The staff are nice.I have found the younger staff are sometimes not overly friendly and don't smile that much. Otherwise yes I like our store."
"I am a satisfied customer because of the awesome customer service I recieve every time I visit New world"
"found what I needed"
"The shop was spacious and staff was friendly. However, there could be more employees working there as there were some lines at the counter. Also, division of entry and exit was somewhat vague. Other than that overall satisfying experience."
"Fast efficient service provided by Staff. Friendly atmosphere within the store. Well stocked shelves and some really good specials. TAYDEN (Training) was excellent. A good check out experience."
"As we are a one income family of 6, I enjoy shopping at New World for the specials!! Good, fair prices all year around. The staff are always happy to assist us with anything & are always very friendly."
"Sometimes the items especially in Dehli area are not fresh. Would really prefer if the staff we nicer and would smile rather then have a sad face on."
"I was able to get all the things i wanted fine however when i got the check out I was told that it was a fast check out and only 10 items this is the check out near the self service three check out operators i had 11 items so i had to go to anthother check out and que now what got me was all three check out operators stood there no customers while i quied i am on a crutch recovering from infection from hip replacement operation and i have artheris in my knees so well done new world you have destroyed you reputation with me what annoyed me most is in the past i have qued in that isle several times in the past with only a few items and there have been folk with full baskets gone through so if that happens again to me ie i am held up while the check out operator puts through more than 10 items i will take a photo and publish it on the net i will also put in complaint to new world head office I AM EXTREMEMLY DISAPPOINTED AS I HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO THIS SHOP FOR YEARS"
"Local"
"The store was well organise, trolleys were clean, produce was of excellent quality. The range at the bakery was less than I expected."
"Helpful friendly staff"
"Very well lit clean and well laid out store. Staff are cheerful and very willing to help. I can buy all my needs there and am able to purchase extras that are not available in the other local supermarkets. The most recent extra I found are veggie crisps in the loose bins. These are a wide range of freeze dried vegetables that make a great healthy snack. I have also been drwn by the reusable containers promotion which will keep food fresher for longer."
"I've already put a complaint through in regards to my recent visit which was terrible"
"Large range of products."
"Friendly staff and very good service."
"Staff always say hullo, if you're looking bewildered looking for something, they ask do you need help. Had to return an expired item and it was no hassle whatsoever"
"New World has the best range of fresh chicken at the best prices. It also has the best range of products."
"I find the layout, selection, variety and service very good"
"Staff are very friendly and helpful. Good range of products. Main reason I shop here is because of the deli, no deli in Countdown Kaikohe"
"Thinking white structuralised white interiorities literary canons filmics and ofcourse Keats."
"Good deals on food friendly check out operator"
"I was very pleased with the cleanliness and organisation of the store and the shelves. There was a large variety of the same product up on the shelves (which were well stocked, too) which is great because it gave me brand options. All of the products and ingredients that we were after were there so we could easily find what we wanted and then get going. Also the prices at New World are usually always very reasonable compared to other stores -(Countdown is closer but we make the trip to New World because of the prices!). The staff were friendly and efficient especially at the checkout but, there was nobody doing our bagging which was disappointing because I usually love it how they have this at New World. Also the promotion on for the storage containers is a great idea and will keep us coming back! Overall it was a very positive supermarket experience. :)"
"I enjoy the wide selection of goods that New World carries. I find I am able get almost everything that I need, from cleaning supplies to food items, all in one stop. This is so important when living the busy lives that we do. Because New World has my everyday needs at my fingertips it opens up more time for the important things, like spending quality time with friends and family. Thank you New World!"
"Marton New World is a great shopping atmosphere with friendly staff."
"The checkout operator was helpful and friendly."
"Store well stocked and good in-store specials. Staff very friendly and helpful. ABBEY on check out was fast, efficient and very friendly. Some more two basket trolleys would be great - there is only one at present and it's always in use - they are great for the small shop."
"Great helpful staff who pack my bags for me, great specialty items you cannot get anywhere else. Great prices on meats! Clean store. Just great all around."
"The store is always clean, shelves are stocked well, and the deli has the best selection of food then any of the other shops. The check out staff and always patient and polite."
"Was able to purchase everything I needed to, to cekevrate my daughter's birthday."
"Great store, well laid out and staff are friendly"
"I usually call into New World on my way to work in the morning - there are always checkouts open and there is no waiting. Service is always helpful and cheerful."
"staff warm"
"The staff are always amazing and helpful"
"Good store layout, very friendly and helpful staff and good range of products"
"It was easy to locate the items I needed and the staff at the check out were very friendly and helpful"
"I like the size of the store and the friendly staff. The fruit and vege are always fresh and the meat is great. There are a lot of options."
"couldn't find your $11 chicken special ... warming cabinet was empty. your ticket pricing descriptions needs improvement"
"I was satisfied with my trip as there is always a range of food available in the deli and bakery making it easy to find something easy and ready to go for dinner."
"STAFF ALWAYS HELPFUL AND OBLIGING WHEN I HAVE A QUERY CHECKOUT STAFF GREAT AND FRIENDLY"
"I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH POD STICKERS TO GET A FULL SET OF BOXES TO BE TOLD THEY HAVE THE PUMPS BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO GO TO PALMERSTON NORTH. WE ARE RETIRED ON A LIMITED INCOME AND CAN'T JUST JUMP IN THE CAR TO DRIVE 20KMS. THERE IS STILL 10 DAYS TO GO ON THIS PROMOTION AND THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS HAVE ENOUGH PRODUCT TO COVER THE THOUSANDS OF STICKERS YOU ISSUED. VERY DISAPPOINTED AND NOT GOOD ENOUTH. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO REMEDY THIS?"
"The store is lovely. It is very clean and has good spaces between aisles. The staff are obviously very well trained because they are professional and friendly."
"high quality fresh fruit"
"Had what I wanted in store, staff were helpful"
"The wee lass at the checkout was very considerate. It was a large shop and she of course noticed I was a pensioner, and when packing my groceries into my hemp bags she was very careful to check if I would be carrying them myself, or had help so that each bag was not made too heavy and I was very grateful for this"
"Store is organised well - easy to find items. Checkout staff are friendly and efficient."
"The customer service is always exellent n really helpfull."
"The staff are always welcoming and friendly, they engage you in conversation. The younger ones do take a little longer to get it but they do get there. Loving the new look in the store, the self serve check out frees up the check outs for me to use. Will never use self serve I like personal service."
"Satisfied: The shop is clean and the aisles are wide."
"compact enough, close to home, not too busy crossing area, clean, light, but I prefere more organic, eco goods, products,, in store constantly"
"We love shopping at New World, Brookfield, Tauranga. The aisles are wide and very spacious and the checkout service is consistently fast,efficient always friendly. Plus we get to have lunch at the in store cafe!!"
"Very disappointed that the latest promotion involving collecting stamps to get food storage containers ended well before the completion date because the supplies ran out. I'm left with three completed fields and cannot collect any containers. Feel quite disillusioned with the process and although the signs said 'until stocks last' feel as though New World understocked for this promotion"
"Satisfied as simple and alot of fresh fruit and veg with no plastic packaging. Dissatisfied with the amount of junk food on shelves and in the freezer. New Zealand food traders should try and help reduce national obesity within children and try and promote a healthy lifestyle by not promote saving deals on junk food. As i see this week there is a discount deal on Cadbury chocolate."
"Reasonably well layed out /aisles a bit narrow. Good wine selection"
"Friendly staff - it's so nice when the regular staff give a wee wave or smile to acknowledge you!"
"Good service lovely clean store with great staff."
"The staff are really lovely and chatty. I also am very pleased that so many stocked brands and New World Remuera itself, are deciding to take a stand against the use of plastics. I like how you can save 5 cents by bringing your own brand and especially the pods collection running at the moment."
"Every time I shop at this branch I am impressed by its service and the assistance I receive. Please allow me though one comment. Being a wheelchair bound disabled person I find on visiting the fresh meat/fish counter I find it so high that I cannot reach the bell to call for attention. I therefor rely on a kind staff member or a member of the public to ring the bell for me. In all other respects any assistance is readily available."
"I'm satisfied cause store just the right size to shop because all goods are display so we older people can reach it and see it better staff helpful and friendly enough parking trolleys just the right height to push"
"checkut ladys are good lookin"
"The staff are amazing they are never to busy to go out if there way to help. The supervisors/checkout operators make new world waiuku an amazing place to shop 😀"
"Very wide range of goods. However the store now does not stock cloudy ammonia which is a staple of mine, so I have to go elsewhere to get this item."
"The staff are always so happy and ready to assist. The store has a nice open feel about it and is always well stocked with fresh items. It is our store of choice when looking for groceries for special occasions"
"Store is always very Clean,There could be more Vegan items but otherwise good"
"The staff are exceptional! The most warm welcoming and accomodating possible. Parking for infants is fabulous."
"Excellent customer service, staff always help if I can't find something, great to do the pods incentive"
"Everything was easy to find"
"I have trouble finding certain international foods at your shops. In other shops they tend to be gathered in one location. The example I had this week was saviordi biscuits for a Tiramisu. They are easy to find at Countdown but I never find them at New World."
"The store is local has a good range of organic food. checkout staff are great and quick and friendly. size of store limits range of some items available, and would really like an instore bakery dept. deli counter is tired and lacks inspiration. good to see that alcohol is no longer by the store entrance. some staff are less than careful where they put their stacking trolleys, and just one at a time per aisle would be better. Labelling on the shelves neeed replacing and need to be bigger on the bottom shelves so you can read them."
"Can never complain as New World is 'our shopping' Meca as it has everything for us as retiree,s ."
"THE STAFF ARE ALWAYS FRIENDLY I AM NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE AISLE SIZE AND SOMETIMES FIND THE NON PERISHABLE SELECTION A LITTLE LIMITED. I SUPPOSE THIS IS DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE SUPERMARKET"
"Clean, easy to navigate store. Lots of variety. Good prices."
"Hand wipes in meat isle I like only problem is that the container with wipes is flowing over often The store is often out of fresh spinach and when I ask about it I am told that I should come in the morning if I want i. I am working full time so that is not possible except when I have time off like at the moment due to sick leave. It would be better if the store could change the ratio of spinach instead of other salad types. I started collecting the Pod stickers and when I had enough for those boxes (1.5l container) I wanted I was told the are out. Not a great experience. I also had to actively ask multiple for the extra sticker promoted in store with some specials like cookies or other things to get them at the checkout. If you create such promotions you should make sure that check out staff can easily see how many they should give you. I would much prefer the little herbs you had before, free reusable bags or simply lower prices for the food items then seein you spending money on stuff like these plastic boxes with stickers and brochures creating a ton of rubbish that you supposingly are avoiding. It seems your words are not in line with your actions there."
"staff friendly and happy and very helpful. it is a boutique supermarket in that it is small which i like. I am comfortable there with the other shoppers as they are more alike and I meet people I know which is nice"
"Staff are always friendly and if I can't find anything will go to someone who does"
"No queues, everything was well laid out and presented, easy to find my items, good selection available of what I was looking for (honey)"
"I find the store an easy layout to find things well merchansied and friendly helpful staff,parking is so easy and close to store and the wet handy wipes at front doors are so thoughtful over all great store no issues at all friendly family vibe not to big and over bearing maybe the bakery could have a bit more selection in cakes ie big cakes"
"Feilding is a nice, new bright shop with very good staff however I am a bit dissappointed in all the extra plastic packaging being used, particularly in the vege and fruit dept. I take reuseable bags with me but often the veges are already packed."
"Great selection, easy to find items, customer service"
"I appreciate the great range available. Especially like the wonderful Deli, meat and fish available. I feel the Butchery is well above average and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. I really enjoy shopping here."
"Love the deli there, so many tempting choices, and the woman that serves there is amazing"
"I am very satisfied with customer service - staff are helpful, friendly, professional and I'm always treated with respect. Excellent service overall. I have never had a bad experience while shopping with Kawerau New World. I'm local and have lived here all my life (38 years to be exact) and I love shopping here."
"It was good and easy"
"The store is always presented nicely and has good customer service."
"Clean well managed store."
"I have always experienced very good service from all the embers of the staff and the shop is so well laid out that it is very easy to find all the products I wish to purchase."
"Amazing deli staff and fresh food"
"I find the range of products excellent and so different to other super markets, the fish section of the store is always well presented and so fresh. I enjoy shopping there and find everything easy access once you've endured Franklin Road.. it's because of the disruption in Franklin Road that I'm not shopping there as I used to !!!!!!!!"
"It is really great to get organic veges at New World but I wish they would keep on eye on food that is growing mould like I found today in the packets of courgettes"
"I managed to find some marked down specials in the 'Depleted Lines and Marked down' area. Always good to find items reduced. I was able to find what I needed very quickly - which is important when you are on a deadline. I was able to be served in good time to be able to get to my next appointment."
"My English was not very good, so I wanted to find something there. Then it was so nice that a girl was working there. She was probably a Mori , so she called a special Indian boy for me and told me"
"I liked the New Zealand brands and I paid prices I am happy with."
"SATISFIED: all things are arranged especially the fresh foods and the Vegetables DISSATISFIED: the disarranged bakery with no place for the nearly expired items"
"Very Satisfied- love the variety of products available"
"I like: The shop has parking It's a little store but well stocked You have an organic veg section and even had Jerusalem artichokes last month The macadamia nuts are very big compared to count down You do free range and grass fed The checkout staff are really nice and friendly I think you could improve Labelling - half the harmony stuff isn't clear which cut it is I have to hunt for free range bacon and so now just buy the brand I recognise instead of there being a section You don't mention grass fed on half the beef is that because some is corn fed or just the labels aren't clear. I want these options but you could make them easier to find You don't mention current food trends eg paleo, ketosis, vegan. Also get some spray free tomatoes- they don't need to be organic but even a step in the right direction helps. You do organic free trade coffee which is great but You could announce it. Please keep some recycling wine boxes for me to pack my stuff when I forget the reusable bags. Please get a bicycle 🚲 park. I have to struggle to tie it to various barriers on a slope which isn't ideal. Also ask the guys doing trolleys in the car park to be more cheerful and friendly."
"Oysters trident awesome!! No rawena bread nor whole duck... bit shocked on overall options between churton park and porirua new worlds and no oystets at others."
"Something has changed. I have shopped here for years. However service has dropped in the last couple of months My free coffee taste yuck My grocery are not packed right. Or not packed. Last right I ended up packing my own eg had to re pack Your pod thingy they ran out stickers Staff don't know how to pack any more. Like no plastic bags but don't leak food in my bag. This is your meat packing Looking elsewhere to shop as the last 6 months your service is dropping"

"Your store is clean and navigatable but a bit pricey at times compared to other stores"
"Easy to find things, great parking and efficient helpful checkout staff"
"I don't think theres much to improve. Maybe a shelf where you put all the reduced items for the time of day they are best before? That might speed me up sometimes. Love you guys !!"
"It's a nice airy spacious new shop"
"I love shopping at new world because it has got good range of products fresh veggies and seafood always fresh nice big supermarket too .Staff are very very friendly and welcoming also."
"Staff are friendly nothing is too much trouble if no special stock on shelf they are happy to get more for you and all goods are displayed well in the fruit and veg department. Don't like shopping but will always go to te kuiti branch with lovely new store. Regards and thanks anita"
"Quick and easy to use, would be nice if slightly bigger. Always friendly staff, clean tidy store."
"I like the staff at New World. They seem happy in their jobs. I like the layout of the store and the items available."
"The store is well laid out and it is easy to find items. I like the freshness of the fruit and vegetables and intend to buy fresh fish in the future as the display looked very good. Checkout staff are always friendly and helpful."
"We obtained everything we wanted at good prices."
"I'm very happy shopping there because the staff are very helpful and courteous the shop is clean there is ample parking and there are always specials to suit everybody. I also appreciate the fact that everything you need is under one roof, from alcohol right through to panties so what more could I ask for, and when I can't get there to shop I can now go online and get it delivered. True dedication towards their customers."
"Aisles are tidy and shelves organised. Check-out staff are exceptionally warm and friendly."
"Loved the shop. Fresh looking fruit and nice looking cuts of meat. Easy to find everything we needed. Will be changing to New World from Count Down where we normally shop."
"Great service from dennis. Disappointed though as o ercharged for item (just looked at receipt when home)."
"Staff are always lovely... We only hav one supermarket in our town and it has very limited space for parking, stock, gets crowded but the staff are always happy to talk giv u a smile, apologise for waiting, which makes the experience bearable at times... They do ther best under very stressful circumstances... a bigger store to cate for our town and outlining areas would help alot"
"BUYING WINE AND THE NEW LAYOUT OF THE WINE AERA WQAS A GREAT IMPORVMENT"
"Helpful staff and quality produce"
"I am always happy to shop at NW. It does require updating."

"It is always very clean and tidy and have good numbers of checkout staff so the lines are not too long"
"ALWAYS SATISFIED; GREAT LAYOUT + GOOD FOOD"
"Nice wide aisles, plenty of parking and friendly staff"
"The ongoing specials instore are great! The wicked Wednesday is always a hit. Always enjoy shopping there. Oh there is 1 thing? I remember the bakery were making these hotcross buns with like a choc coconut icing similar to the raspberry sally buns or luns or whatever it was. I bought 1 to try out. It was very good. But the following week it was gone. This was about 3-4 months ago now haha. So a little disappointed they weren't kept around abit longer, But otherwise new world is pretty meke cuzzy!"
"See my online feedback, about the self check out register system. Weird storing of names. Rock Melon, has to be searched for under Melon, Rock for example."
"The store was well stocked and easy to get around. For some reason I seem to get around and out of the store so much quicker than when I shopped at Countdown The Valley. The lady on the deli counter was friendly and efficient. Importantly for me most of the checkouts were open and the queues small. I can't stand long queues and it is one of the many reasons I stopped shopping at Countdown. The checkout girl was quick and friendly."
"Everything is usually in stock and in the brands that I prefer. The staff are always very friendly and helpful. There are a lot of promotions and competitions to engage shoppers and bring in new clientele."
"The store was very clean and tidy making it satisfying. Everything was clearly labled, and the staff were very friendly and worked efficiently. The aisles were clearly labled, and the self checkout was simple to understand. I would highly recommend this store to a friend or a family member which is why I am very satisfied with my shopping experience at New World Botany."
"Most usually friendly helpful staff. Some products are no longer stocked so this is a nuisance as used to do all shopping at this store - but now have to go elsewhere. This means sometimes it's just easier to do all the shopping at the other store - and it means then that New World loses a customer - or is it in fact more customers for the same reason?"
"I was not given the stickers for the current promotion. When I realized today that I had not been given any stickers I rang the store. However the telephone system appears to be faulty as when I pushed one as prompted for the duty manager I was twice disconnected. The third time I rang I selected the help-desk and spoke with a friendly and very polite woman who told me that the telephone system is always playing up. She also told me that there are no more stickers and no more pods despite the promotion still running until the 14th. I asked for an email so that I could write to express my dismay that Porirua New World was not supporting the promotion through to the end. The woman on the phone kindly told me that she was not allowed to give out information such as an email address. She offered to call the duty manager however after waiting for more than 5 minutes I rang off. An inability to talk with anyone in authority without visiting the store appears to suggest total disregard for the customer."
"Have most of the products I need and staff are always super friendly"
"Good service cheerful"
"The staff could smile and be more friendly, more staff, more assistance at self checkout."
"Good service"
"QUICKLY FOUND WHAT I REQUIRED"

"Great layout, lots of room, well lit and friendly staff"
"Satisfied had everything I needed"
"Can't use app on iPhone to scan Club Card number - needs to be typed in manually"
"The staff are helpful and it is easy to find my way around the shop. It makes it easy to shop there because they have the baby parks right beside the trolleys. This was most useful when my baby was young."
"It's generally good but we need cheaper prices but the staff are friendly and helpful"
"The store is always clean and tidy, the layout is easy to follow and is spacious so as not to be running trolleys into other customers. The specials are generally clearly labelled and there are more often than not some good deals for customers."
"very clean and tidy and staff are very helpful."
"usually you can find a wide range of good products but a bit expensive"
"We like the bakery in the store as well as those take away foods, the services provided at the store are also nice"
"NOTE - this is a repeat of the just filled in www.feedback.fyi form GMAKANW (Clubcard code 6014 3555 2677 6074) Third shop in a row where the shopping experience has not been good enough - to the stage of doing this online feedback. This shop has gone backwards and it is becoming a struggle to return. As you will see from our Clubcard, we have been regular shoppers at Mt Roskill so have past experience to draw upon. PODS after spending $435.00 this morning we were told the Pods Promotion finished yesterday and were given no stickers. Went home and checked online and this is not correct. Rung the store and it seems that Mt Roskill has run out of Pods so are telling people it is finished. Now this error was not only with our checkout operator, but also the other staff on the adjacent checkouts, as they must surely have heard us query this - multiple times we asked when it had finished - and they did not correct the error. Our operator Haripriya G, was very nice and opened her checkout as soon as we joined a queue, but was not instructed properly in this case. **If PODS are finished at all shops due to no stock, then tell us that. At this stage I am not sure if that is actually the case??? Cannelloni Shells - Yes I know it was early Sunday morning, but only 1 packet on the shelf, and that was opened. We do expect better of NW. Food in the porch and trolley's outside. Sorry to see that this is continuing. It is actually a conversation/comment about the shop we have raised with others - in a negative manner. Already found another who also finds it annoying, suspect that this is not a popular thing. Stephanie & Stephen O'Hanlon"
"They have great meal options with quick service and amazing staff"
"nice clean store with loads of parking"
"One of your suppliers(Pams)has changed their bread, very disappointed and looking at changing brand."

"Very nice and easy, in and out. The Customer service is great and friendly as well."
"I like the layout of NW as well the lighting and of course the products! Vegies and fruits alsways nice and fresh, and all the other staff welcoming good quality, specially the fresh meat stand. I also appreciate the Specials. The employees alwayes helpfull icase I cannot find s.th."

"Very friendly staff"
"It's a wonderful store. So clean and fresh. The staff are wonderful and always helpful ."

"Quick and easy the self check outs are perfect for quick shops and the friendly staff are there to help with the big main shops. This new world also has nice fresh breads"
"The store was tidy and everything was easy to find - made it an efficient visit and a pleasant experience."

"Nice collection of products. Efficient checkouts for a compact store with so many customers."
"Store is well laid out and modern"
"Friendly staff, store is easy to get around quickly and has a good selection of stock for a smaller store"
"Would like the shop to have later hours and more ready made food"
"Ngaruawahia New World is my local super market in my home town.. I have shopped there for most of my life which is 45 years. I know the aisles where to get my items which makes it fast for shopping. Over the years check out operators have come and gone but there is still a few that have been there many years which gives the super market a friendly and familiar experience to shop, new staff also always friendly. I like my local new world will probably always shop there. Also the fact there are good specials and deals every week keep me going back.. $3 nescafe 10 pkt sachet coffees on dollar day was a great bargain and savings.. NEW WORLD the way I like to shop."
"The new packaging for the baked in store cakes has reduced the size of the cakes. Our team often purchases these cakes for smoko shouts in our office and the reduced size makes these less attractive."
"I am very Satisfied Shopping at New World."
"I feel like maybe there isn't enough staff on especially after work hours. there can sometime be a long wait especially at the lotto counter"
"I enjoy shopping at New World Birkenhead as the supermarket always have fresh produce and is clean. The staff are always friendly (especially the checkout) and the supermarket is setup in a way that is appropriate - so when I go through the supermarket everything is organise and I know where to get everything or where to source something that might not be my usual product based on the layout of the store (which is great!). All of these things makes me satisfied."
"range is good, but often the specials are not applied and I end up paying full price for a special which now makes me have to check my docket every time"
"Freedom Virtue Liberty or that same old song"
"It was a very great shop nice and clean and very nice people that work there."
"The staff are friendly and helpful. It is close to home so it is easy to get to. It is not a big as the new world in whakatane and doesn't have the same range of groceries but overall you can't complain because it doesn't have the same volume of customers"
"The set out of the shop is very good and flows well. The staff are friendly and helpful and will help to find an item which maybe I cannot locate."
"I love the store environment. Everything is well laid out and shopping is stress free. Love the choices available. Appreciate that the tills are well manned for those who prefer."

"I really like the range of brands and products that the store offers. I am able to try different brands at an affordable price that are not generally available in other stores."
"friendly staff, great produce and location"
"Havelock New World is far to small, and its over crowded. 99% of the time we have to stand in line to be served. Sometimes I've had to stand over where the milk is stored, that just shows you how long the que can get. It's just ridiculous. A lot of my friends in Havelock North have had enough of this, and have started shopping elsewhere to save themselves time. When are you going to build a new super market in Havelock?"
"Good choices of product and the bakery is especially excellent at NW stonefields. I now go in to buy picnic food there if I'm too busy to make it at home."
"Not much deals & specials"
"I liked how there were a good amount of staff at the checkouts (the more the better for customer service) and how someone greeted me on the way out."
"We asily idenitied and found what we were looking for."
"Just love everything from how great the staff are, love how they pack your bags, have a good knowledge of the food in store. Love how there is such a big and better selection of food available then other stores"
"Very good experience, the only thing would be the price of things is rising"
"They had what I needed and some of the specials were great"
"I found what I needed easily"
"My 92 year old mother usually shops local at new World and has done for the last 30 plus years. She is usually very happy with the service. At the beginning of the month she shopped as usual. At the checkout she was served by Corban as on the receipt as cashiers name. She left the shop feeling intimidated with the abrupt service at the way he spoke to her. She remains independent and drives 20 minutes to get to Kaikohe and we would like this to continue with her feeling safe. Thank you concerned daughter."
"Nice new and clean store. Occasionally I am unable to find what I am looking for. Like getting airpoints when I shop as do not use Flybuys"
"great bakery and deli. Large range of gluten free products. Great service on checkout."
"store easy to navigate, and staff always friendly"
"clean well stocked store friendly staff"
"I bought bread rolls and salad to take to a lunch. There were a good range of tasty bread rolls, but I thought the salad was too expensive!"
"Always a good range of products that I like that aren't found at other supermarkets. The store is a pleasant environment to shop in. The staff are friendly and helpful."
"The staff are ALWAYS friendly . the selection is good . prices are reasonable. Specials are good ."
"Great selection of food at good prices and friendly staff"
"I have visited New World and have been surprised by chosen overseas products. What surprised me was good choice of pesto, good choice of olives, cheese, tomato, grown in NZ, has very good taste, and have to mention that salad is delicious. A vegetarian who loves carefully chosen products and NW became regularly visited store ever since first time. Like mentioned at the short survey, paper bags would be something that would make the great service even greater, not only for costumers, but also environment. Thanks."
"I am satisfied with the high quality brands that are available."
"A couple of items that I needed were out of stock. These were also in the weekly mailer and with it being only Monday would expect that they would be available. Checkout girl also seemed hugely inconvenienced with a shoulder slump and glare when I asked to remove an item -the pricing was not what I thought. Kind just topped off the out of stock items disappointment."
"Switch to paper bags for veges is very nice. Range is generally good, but for some items forced to go to other supermarkets such as Kecap Manis and spices - go to Bin Inn in Warkworth for many spices, though not always significantly cheaper Meat prices generally higher than at supermarkets in Auckland"
"Satisfied: Enjoy using the new self-checkouts. Staff are always very helpful. Dissatisfied: Price tags on the edges of shelves and freezers often don't match the items they're next to. Today I was looking for the price of the Pam's Free Range Whole Chicken and there were no price tags to be found for the large quantity of Pam's Free Range Chickens in the freezer. Also there were several Brink's Free Range Chicken price tags but no Brink's Free Range Chickens ..."
"Lovely friendly staff"
"I am very annoyed with the way the New World pods cards are being handled at my local branch. We are just under a week away from the promotion being completed and my branch is no longer providing the collector cards but are still giving out stickers. I have enough stickers to get another pod but cannot collect it as i have run out of cards to put them on. This is very poorly run and does not endeer me to New World."
"I don't get the point of the club card. What is it for ?"
"Customer service here is always excellent. Staff are always friendly and greet you with a smile."
"Accessibility with a baby (parking and with capsule trolleys). Friendly helpful staff at checkout & counters. Great range of products. Flybuys."

"I really like the wide selection of goods that are available at the store. I am have the choice to try brands I would not normally see at other stores or not normally buy."
"Personally welcomed by a staff member at the entrance and handed a basket each time i visit. Staff are always warm and welcoming and the store is always fully stoked, with helpful team on the isles. I choose to got to East Ridge New World each time I shop."
"The staff are always pleasant. The store is always clean and usually has everything I need."
"The store had a great intuitive layout making it easy to find what i was looking for. the staff was helpful and friendly"
"The staff are fantastic, nothing is ever a bother and they are friendly and helpful. They even know me by name."
"PRODUCT RANGE, EASE OF SHOPPING, FAMILY ORIENTATED SHOP, FAMILY FRIENDLY"
"location, family friendly, all items in supermarket"
"When I shop in good faith and then find that your promotions are nothing but a scam I am totally disillusioned. Being an older person I have no alternative but to shop at New World as we have no other outlets."
"The meat prepackaged was not the best cuts (hubby was a butcher), so we thought we would purchase from the meat bar, but they steak is just way too thick, we like a thick steak but these were ridiculously thick so we couldn't purchase"
"Great service"
"I had to wait for a while before I got served by someone at the pastry/bakery section. I did not have to wait at all for a self-checkout machine."
"Close and convenient"
"Tuesday appears to be a good day, few shoppers as it was an emergency shop for me today, loved the layouts, love the butchery and meats for singles and family packages. Would like to see more reusable bags displayed, and cooler bags."
"#ERROR!"
"I really like NW Stonefields, the aisles seem wider, the store is light and clean and it's easy to find what I want. The produce is always fresh and appealing. The checkout staff are friendly. You guys beat the Eastridge store by miles!! Thanks NW Stonefields 👍🏻"
"The checkout operator, Kirsten, was friendly and very helpful. It was pleasant chatting to her. It's nice talking to a human, the self-check outs are boring."
"Staff always cheerful, helpful and courteous. I know many of checkout quite well as shop almost everyday!"
"Excellent customer services the quality of its product and the price range is very affordable. Keep up with provision of quality service delivery."
"Loving the new fit out - looks great!"
"Wider aisles and great displays. Checkout is faster and usually has a packer as well. Store is always clean. The variety is fantastic and I can source alot of items not available as my closest supermarket. When ever I am in the area or have the opportunity, I will visit Stonefields store."
"The people are really helpful and seem to enjoy there job. The people are what can make a good business great. Some issues perhaps with layout of the store- Some items could perhaps have a reshuffle like the specialty GF section. Could join the other baking items."
"I feel like the deals could be better - I saw a deal for Pams Butter - it said it was a super saver - but it didn't say how much I was saving and so I didn't buy it"
"They usually have most things I need but sometimes I need to go to the bigger stores in town to get other items"
"wide selection of gourmet and everyday items. clean store and easy to navigate. good service from staff too."
"friendly staff"
"The shop layout is the best!"
"I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO TUESDAY WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I GO TO NEW WORLD.WE HAVE SHOPPED THERE SINCE NEW WORLD STARTED AT BROOKFIELD AS WE LIVE CLOSE TO IT.WE OFTEN BUMP INTO PEOPLE WE KNOW.WE THINK THE STAFF ARE VERY NICE AND ALWAYS HELPFUL.WE ALWAYS GO TO THE CAFE AFTER AND ENJOY THE COFFEE."
"Great shop never had a reason to be dissatisfied with any of the Devonport New World features."
"Satisfied. Above all it is the tolerance and help given to the older members of our community. People are unfailingly kind in their assistance with finding a product, telling you where it is & even leading you there if you still look confused. Last year I was looking for spices to make pickled onions & after staring at the spice shelf for a long time I asked for help. I was gently indicated a giant stand directly behind me (big seasonal display opposite the spices, anticipating the demand) where there was little but the very thing I was looking for. Nobody laughed at me, just chuckled WITH me. They will chat with you if you want that, when you want that, but don't initiate this if you do not want it. The food is fresh and of good quality. The shop is not too big, so you are able to get in & around without getting too tired. I am pleased to see an employee who may have a mild learning disability working mostly in the carpark area collecting trollies. Indeed he is not only a hard worker but unfailingly cheerful. It is excellent that NW has a policy of inclusion, if that is what it is. Thanks for all the smiles."
"All Good"
"I like how there is always speciality foods, such as dairy free cheeses and coconut yoghurt. Sometimes they run out of little island coconut milk but it's always in by the next day. The staff are super kind and friendly, they will help if you can't find something and the butchery department are amazing!"
"The products are well displayed. I like that the front entrance has been changed and it is easier to get around the fruit and vegetable section. I have noticed too that you are using recycled plastic for the kiwifruit containers and that the food storage pods are also recyclable. The food storage pods are a good idea. There is a good selection of produce and it is fresh and appealing to look at."
"Good selection of what I needed and easy parking."
"The staff a very friendly and the shop is clean and tidy. i do have trouble with the fruit and vegetables staying fresh for any length of time. I bought lemons on Saturday and by Monday one was rotten. When do lemons go rotten that quick? or the bagged carrots go slimey within a couple of days in the fridge."
"Great products fresh, easy to find what you are looking for, clean and tidy and excellent customer service"
"The store is always clean, organised and the staff are so very friendly. The prices are always so very competitive and the atmosphere is just lovely."
"Easy and close to my place . Have all products that I need ."
"As a recent arrival in levin I am very pleased that new World here is such a fine store. All staff are helpful and also appear totally happy in their work place. Excellent."
"Good selection but would like Birkenhead New World to stock So Good unsweetened almond milk and Burgen Gluten Free bread range."
"Staff are amazing"
"Fast, friendly staff. Cleanliness of store. Tidy also!"
"I FEEL THE PRICING IS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER SUPER MARKETS BUT IT IS VERY CLEAN AND PRESENTABLE OVERALL"
"Shop not too busy - only behind one person at checkout counter"
"Sweet as"
"Its good to shop for house food needs, however we are dependent on Indian Spice Land, Yogiji's Food mart and some Indian shops which are not available in NW"
"i need more offer of the fruit"
"There were no Pascal Marshmallows on the shelf, one of your lovely ladies went to see if there were any in the back. It took a while, so I was feeling quite uncomfortable standing in the aisle waiting for her return. She did and I bought 2 packets. My favourite chocolate Cadbury's Caramilk is still not stocked yet?????"
"Love how you can get lotto and a coffee as well as my groceries"
"Lovely new building with flat, spacious parking lot. Well staffed checkouts. Always open up another lane if the ques get beyond 2 people waiting in each. Much appreciated."
"Store was very well stocked and clean and tidy. Staff were very friendly and helpful. LINDA on check out was very fast, efficient and friendly. I really appreciated her careful packing skills to try and avoid damage to items I'd purchased. VERY DISAPPOINTED to find that the 'POD' promotion had finished 9 days earlier than advertised - especially when told that the full card of collected stickers could not be honored!! Made the promo a bit of a waste of time.. NOT blaming our LOCAL store as it's a Nation wide promo, just poorly handled...."
"The Staff of Regent New World are so friendly and really helpful."
"Prices could be more competitive"
"As I had done my weekly shop earlier in the week I went on Friday especially to get some of the scallops that were advertised in the email I was sent as I'd missed out the previous time. However I was told that they don't have them as they're too expensive. Very disappointed - why not say in the email that it's not available at Manurewa?"
"It's great shoppingat new world's have no complaints"
"I like the staff, same regular staff that you get to know, they don't have a high turnover at this store."
"Tidy, Friendly staff, Ease of parking (with kids) Ease of layout"
"varieties of fresh food .good service"
"Still struggle with the layout of this store even though I have regularly shopped there since it opened, the layout is just not logical to me"
"Need Flora ProActive Ultra Low Fat on shelves and also Pam's Ginger Beer soft drink on shelves."
"Good selection, especially the wine section. The pricing of value range products and Pam's should be the same as PAK'nSAVE. There are some instances where there is a few dollars difference."
"Love the layout of the store and the selection in the bakery and deli is excellent"
"I have been shopping at my local NW ever since I moved here 6 years ago and have seen the Pams goods take place. The bakery is a favourite of mine the bread is delicious I buy it every week. I am very organized and usually buy everything for the week, it is very rare that I use any other food shop."
"Was able to get a few items at good prices, which is rare these days as everything (except junk food/drink) seems to be going up every other week."
"I like te recycle of soft plastics option. Great! I liked to wine section - good discounts on medium to good wines Had all we needed for a weekly shop except for one sanitary item."
"The vaireties are not stocked for example nappies sizes. The cleanliness and organisation of the shop is lovely. Staff are lovely also"
"the staff are lovely"
"Always satisfied when I shop at the Matamata store, friendly, helpful and have a great GF selection"
"Got what we wanted"
"We go to Auckland from the Coromandel once a month and always shop at New World. The staff are great, there is a very good variety of food available and we love your wine specials and particularly your delicatessen."
"Always my best supermarket and it is easy to find something"
"Its a great shop, I think that the new owners are doing a great job and the shop now seems more open and less cluttered."
"Pricing too high, specials price tickets too small to read, and do not draw you to the weeks specials, (take note of the bishopdale branch, that is what they should look like if you want to draw our attention) especially if you can not download the virtual mailer to read before hand, (it will not open on my computer and I have latest reader available for downloads,), the pdf version is not there to download either now and can not check anything on your online site unless it is the very few weekly specials you display. Self service checkout prints out a big, paper wasting docket for petrol savings, but I don't own a car so don't need that, couldn't there be a button to ask us if we want it printed? I spoke to supervisor for that area about it and she just laughed at me!!! Your computer just inside the door for us to use doesn't work, 3rd time I have tried it, today I wanted to put that comment in but it wouldn't input the option I wanted to put in, so pointless having that there."
"SATISFIED Easy to shop found what I wanted and quick through checkouts"
"the friendly staff and quality of products ALLGOOD"
"All the assistants are helpful and cheerful. When waiting at the checkout if there is more than one person being 'processed' the superintendent always calls for another till to be opened so even with a full trolley there is only minimal delay."
"There was a good range of products in the bakery and deli to get a meal together right away without any fuss. Lots of tasty looking items. Some were a bit too expensive for me though."
"Nice staff who smile & remember you Good selection of food and prices"
"Amazing products"
"good layout"
"Every time I go here I am always greeted by everyone with a smile as I walk through the shop. At the checkout they are always welcoming and pleasant. Love shopping here as it is easy to find what I am looking for or someone is always willing to assist. Keep it up Cambridge you all rock!!!"
"The meat and fish are very fresh and we buy steaks and salmon from the store all the time. This is the only store we buy those stuff because of the high quality."
"All the staff were polite and never treated me as a bother"
"I Love the shop because it is light and well set out. Also, the items are reachable on the shelves with no stretching to get things that are too high up. The staff are always so polite and helpful and, they stop you in the aisles if you are looking for something and ask you if they can help Thanks"
"The staff are always friendly and helpful."
"Satisfied because I got what I needed and not extremely satisfied because I like more discounted prices"
"Friendly Staff and good product selection."
"I am a single mother with 4 grown children ages from 14-7yrs old. Meat wise is so expensive and there's no family packs. Mainly for a family of one/two children. Please help ASAP"
"As I was dong a top up shop everything I required was available and fresh. The staff, as usual, were friendly, helpful and pleasant."
"Very helpful staff, good taster lady although I didn't try any samples she seemed to really interact with customers. Great store lay out"
"The layout of the shop is good, not to busy. Prices for meat could be better, cheaper deals. Service is generally fast, no/small lines, but staff can be sometimes be distracted and not as customer focused/engaged. However, in saying that they are in no way rude and do the job."
"I am satisfied with the quality of the products available at New World. I am also satisfied with the number of discounts I have received from New World while buying products I normally need."
"Very helpful and friendly staff."
"I found what I wanted - in stock."
"New World Hastings stocks the items that I like to buy, and they are always good quality. Today was great because two of the meat items I had on my list were on good specials. Sometimes when that happens I miss out on what I just wanted to buy because other people have cleaned out the well priced stock, but today there was plenty."
"I liked the quick self-checkout. I would like to see a larger selection of ready meals and the sushi could be better."
"Came, did what I needed and left, nothing positive or negative stood out."
"Very fast to go through self checkout even though shop very busy. Friendly staff!"
"Staff are friendly Place is clean Feeling is calm I can find everything I need"
"Brookfield New World has always has a excellent range of gluten free products and this is very important to us, the staff in the deli and bakery are ourstanding and always polite and professional. The fruit and vege department is always very clean and I love how things are always presented beautifully and all of the produce is always fresh! The selection of meats are on par with other local stores, we do not buy seafood from this site as we source it from family in the seafood industry. The cafe is a nice touch to the store, it adds a nice vibe to the store. I love the extensive range of flowers available and often buy fresh plants as have always had great healthy plants from ALL new worlds. One thing that stands our for this site is the bakery and deli, the ready to buy meals are well made and perfect for the large amount of older people in the local area, as well as the half cakes and all of the beautiful delghts they offer. the only thing that I do not like about this site is that the isles are not wide enough, even another 10 inches each isle would be helpful."
"I found the staff helpful and happy. Every staff member I passed I smiled & got a smile back."
"more discounts"
"I like the shopping environment. Most things I buy are stocked there and I can get at least some air points (not much but at least something). The only thing that was a bit disappointing is that not all the stock was in for the cat food and my eyedrops never gets sold there (the Optrex sore eyes eye drops)."
"Great selection of product; good sales."
"I found the staff to be very helpful especially when I have my elderly Mother with me. New World New Plymouth is clean, friendly and easy to get around. I especially like the range of wines and the bakery."
"Satisfied always , never having to wait long while in a que, everyone is helpful and kind. Have never had any problems with New World Tokoroa LOVE LOVE LOVE IT 😉"
"The self check doesn't seem to like you using your own bags! Unknown item, unknown item over and over! So then you have to get someone over to sort it out so you wish you had just got into a normal queue because it would have been quicker and less annoying. lol However the girl you helped me out was great!"
"There is a lot of good quality selection of grocery items. I like how the produce is labels with 'handwritten' labels, make it feel like a speciality shop rather than a big box store. The aisles are a little too close together and it would be helpful if there were more clearly visible labels identifying what items are in the aisles."
"My overall experience with New World is usually that of satisfaction when I leave the store. The Kumeu Branch is great though. Coming in weekly to see familiar faces helps makes my shopping easier for me. I enjoy collecting the pods stickers at the moment and am very happy with the idea of getting the containers! I always do need help on the self check outs though, as sometimes they don't work out well for me, but the staff are always right there to help me."
"As a single person I do not spend a great deal on groceries, but have been following your Pod campaign studiously including shopping at New World when in other regions just so I can get my pod stickers. As the campaign closes on the 14th October, I went to collect my container (as I already had a pump) just to find out there were no products left due to a 'Two for One' promotion a while back. This makes all my collecting a waste of time. I was told there were supplies in Christchurch, but a 496km round trip for a small plastic container doesn't seem very cost effective to me."
"My husband and I like going to Cambridge New World because there is a relaxed atmosphere without loud rock music and the staff are so supportive and obliging."
"Ever since the day I moved to Kawerau from Wellington, (1991 in case you're wondering) I have had NOTHING but excellent, friendly service in store. It doesn't matter which checkout operator serves me or who packs my stuff, EVERYONE working here is bloody awesome."
"Always friendly service. Alpa the checkout lady reminded me that the Pod promotion was finishing on Sunday and to take my completed cards in to a city shop as they've run out of containers at this store. This was very helpful as I tend to forget when these promotions finish."
"Always helpfull and happy to help staff.checkout operators always happy and talk.love your shop rototuna"
"The staff are very helpful and cheerful at the checkouts. I enjoy shopping at the new store."

"Mussells where open and may be suspect condition Grapes especially good value Pick and mix well looked after"
"I would class myself as a foodie, and I love that I can usually find most ingredients for our meals that are a range of different cuisines. The fresh fish and butchery section is wonderful. The one area I'd really like to see improve is the NZ wine selection in the mid-range $18 - $30 per bottle."
"Redcliffs NW is a small shop and often doesn't have the products I am looking for. I do my main shop somewhere else but it's great to have New World at the end of the street for basics, even if they are more expensive than the opposition. Very friendly helpful staff, always cheerful and supportive."
"A GREAT SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. STORE CLEAN AN TIDY, SHELVES WELL STOCKED AND GOOD SPECIALS. Staff very friendly and helpful. HARRIET at Check Out was very friendly, fast, efficient and packed my items well to avoid damage/crushing. Some more two basket trolleys would be great - only one and that's always in use!!!! These are great for smaller loads of shopping - when you are just doing a 'Top Up Shop'.."
"It is easy to find what you are looking for and promotions,however I guess that comes with regular shopping at the same place"
"I love the fact that I can always get a parking spot on flat ground. I love the fact that all areas of the store are set out in a way you can grab off the shelf and straight into the trolley with no hustle and bustle of other people and their trolleys. I love the fact that all the produce is so incredibly fresh (all the time). I love the fact that customer service I am provided with by all the workers at the New Lynn NW are so incredibly genuinely friendly and so very helpful. I love the fact that there is always a packer at the end of each check out which makes the process of shopping so much easier for busy Mums finishing work. I say it is always a pleasure to shop at New World, you are guaranteed service with a smile!!!"
